Details of the run_analysis.R script is given below.

1) The dataset is unzipped first to extract files.

2) Each data is assigned a variable to ensure easy understanding of the data.
features <- features.txt: 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

3) Merging of the training & test to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merged_data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4) Extract mean & standard deviation of all measurements
tidy_data (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting merged_data, selecting only columns: 
subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5) Activities are assigned proper names
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

6) Appropriate labels assigned to data variables
Code column in tidy_data renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

7) Final, tidy data is created and exported
final_data (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing tidy_data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export final_data into FinalData_1.txt file.
